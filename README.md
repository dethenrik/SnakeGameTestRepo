## Overview

**SnakeGameTestRepo** showcases a basic Snake game with:
- A **Menu screen** to navigate between the game, high scores, async examples, and settings.
- A **Settings** screen to switch between **Button-based** or **Swipe-based** movement controls.
- A **High Scores** screen that persists and displays high scores using `SharedPreferences`.
- Basic **async** operations (like calling a demo API).

The code is organized in Kotlin files with Jetpack Compose, and uses `build.gradle.kts` scripts for configuration.

Known Errors
Below are a few errors that have been encountered and possible fixes:

Device emulator-5554 not found

Cause: The AVD is not running or adb is not detecting it.
Solution:
Ensure your emulator is actually running (check Device Manager).
Restart adb by running adb kill-server then adb start-server in a terminal.
Close conflicting emulators and re-run your device.
Gradle Sync Failures

Cause: Missing plugins, incorrect Kotlin or Compose versions, or outdated Gradle.
Solution:
Update your Gradle version in gradle-wrapper.properties.
Make sure the Compose version matches your Kotlin version in build.gradle.kts.
In Android Studio, go to File > Settings > Build... > Gradle, confirm the correct settings.
Missing SDK or Wrong API Level

Cause: The project uses compileSdk 35, but your system might not have it installed.
Solution:
Open File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK.
